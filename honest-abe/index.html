		<h1>Abraham "Honest Abe" Lincoln</h1>
		<h2>President of the United States of America - 1861 to 1865</h2>
		<div class="personal-statement">
		<p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>
		<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is althogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
